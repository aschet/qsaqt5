# Qt Script for Applications (QSA) for Qt 5

This venture tries to revive the corpse of QSA or Qt Script for Applications in a way so that is compiles against the Qt 5.x series. QSA is a scripting framework initially created for Qt 3 that not only containes an ECMAScript interpreter but also an IDE. Unfortunately QSA was shelfed and the superseding projects did not offer the same level of features again.
