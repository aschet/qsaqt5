Installing Qt Script for Applications (QSA)
-------------------------------------------

This version of QSA requires Qt 4.0.1 or newer. It will not work
against Qt 3 or Qt 4.0.0.

Make sure that the $QTDIR environment variable points to the Qt
installation directory and that $QTDIR/bin is in your PATH and
$QTDIR/lib has to specified in your library path.


Unix or Mac:
------------
./configure
make


Windows:
--------
configure
nmake

*********************************************************************
Alternatively:
It is possible to do a make install, by configuring with -prefix:

configure -prefix dest_dir
make
make install


*********************************************************************
It is possible to configure with -no-editor to have QSA build without
the QSWorkbench and QSEditor classes. QSA will not depend on the Qt3
support library in this configuration

For further information on Qt Script for Applications, 
see the README file.


*********************************************************************
Launching QSA applications from the Finder on Mac

If you built Qt and QSA statically option, your executables will
contain the Qt library and can be run from Finder
automatically. Otherwise, your executables will need to use the Qt
library on your system. You can achieve this by using symbolic
links.

    ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqsa.1.dylib /usr/lib

You may need to have 'administrator' access to do this, (in which
case, precede each command with 'sudo', e.g. 'sudo ln -s ...'). If
you use sudo you'll be prompted for your password.

If you do not have administrator access, or you would prefer to do
a user install (rather than system install) of the libraries you 
can do:

ln -sf $QTDIR/lib/libqsa.1.dylib $HOME/lib

Note: you can also achieve similar functionality by adding your
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to the GUI's environment.
