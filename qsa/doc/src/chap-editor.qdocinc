The editor displays two tabs by default to be able to switch between
scripts. Every time a new script file is created, a corresponding tab
is displayed in the source code editor. To close tabs, click \Menu
{File|Close Tab} or press \Key{Ctrl+Q}.

To write script code, just start typing text directly into the editor.
To make changes to the editors properties, click \Menu
{Edit|Preferences}.

Right-click the editor to get a context menu of options, for example,
"Comment Code" or "Uncomment Code" to add or remove comments from the
script code.
