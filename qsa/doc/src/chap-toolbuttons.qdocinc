\chapter Reference: Toolbar Buttons

\section1 Introduction

\QSAD's toolbar buttons provide fast access to common functionality.
Toolbar buttons are grouped in several toolbars. Toolbars have a
handle at the left hand side which can be clicked to minimize the
toolbar. Toolbars that have been minimized have their handle appear
just under the menu bar; click the handle to restore the toolbar to
the last position it occupied. You can drag a toolbar's handle to move
the toolbar to a different position in the toolbar area. Toolbars can
be dragged out of the toolbar area entirely and made into stand-alone
tool dock windows. To hide a tool dock window click its close button.
To restore a hidden tool dock window, right click the tool area, then
click the name of the tool dock window you wish to restore.
