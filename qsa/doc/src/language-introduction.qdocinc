\chapter Introduction

\Q's scripting language is called \QS, and it is an implementation of a subset of ECMAScript
4.0. ECMAScript is also called JavaScript or JScript by some vendors.

\QS provides the language features of ECMAScript, for example, \l
while loops, \l class and \l function definitions, etc.

\QS also supports Trolltech's innovative signals and slots mechanism.
Signals and slots provide type-safe inter-object communication that
supercedes the crash-prone callbacks and message maps approaches used
by older tools.

This language reference describes the language features provided by
\QS. It is divided into the following chapters:
\list
\i \l{Qt Script Language Concepts}
\i \l{Built-in Types and Objects}
\i \l{Built-in Variables and Constants}
\i \l{Built-in Functions and Operators} 
\i \l{Control Statements}
\endlist

Readers are assumed to have a basic understanding of programming, and
to have read the \l {Getting Started with QSA}
guide that introduces \QS.
