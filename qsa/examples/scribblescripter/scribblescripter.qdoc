\title Scribblescripter Example


The Scribblescripter example is a simple drawing application which
allows the end user to write macros to create drawings. The developer
creates the Scribblescripter application and then makes it scriptable
so that the end user can create their own scripts. The following
text describes the application from the end user point of view,
followed by a quick demonstration in how to create a new function for
the application.

The toolbar for this example is a standard toolbar that the
application's developer has created. The Scribblescripts window is on
the left side of the application and it displays a list of classes
and functions that the user has implemented in Qt Script. If the
user double clicks on a function in the list, the function is
executed. For demonstration purposes, there are already four functions
in the list. The right side of the application shows a drawing canvas
which is exposed as an application object so that the user can access
it from QSA.

The application developer also includes two buttons at the bottom of
the Scribblescripts window. To create and edit scripts, click the Edit
Scripts button to open the QSA Workbench, where one can edit
scripts. The user clicks the Update button to refresh the list in the
Scribblescripts window if a new function has been created. The
Scribblescripter example exposes one application object, the canvas.

The API of its interface is as follows:

\code
CanvasInterface:

Functions:

PixmapInterface pixmap();
setPixmap( PixmapInterface pixmap );
Number width();
Number height();
Number visibleWidth();
Number visibleHeight();
\endcode

The API of the Pixmap interface which is used in the canvas interface
is as follows:

\code 
PixmapInterface:

Properties:

Color color
QColor background
Number penWidth

Functions:

PixmapInterface pixmap()
setPixmap( PixmapInterface pixmap )
clear()
fillRect( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
scale( Number sx, Number sy )
shear( Number sh, Number sv )
rotate( Number val )
translate( Number dx, Number dy )
drawPoint( Number x, Number y )
moveTo( Number x, Number y )
lineTo( Number x, Number y )
drawLine( Number x1, Number y1, Number x2, Number y2 )
drawRect( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
drawWinFocusRect( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
drawRoundRect( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h, Number xRnd, Number yRnd )
drawEllipse( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
drawArc( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h, Number a, Number alen )
drawPie( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h, Number a, Number alen )
drawChord( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h, Number a, Number alen )
drawText( QString text, Number x, Number y )
eraseRect( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
setWindow( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
setViewport( Number x, Number y, Number w, Number h )
resize( Number w, Number h )

\endcode

\section1 Describing the four example scripts

\section2 paintText()

This function opens a dialog to ask the user for some
parameters,such as which text to draw, how often to draw it, etc. When
the user accepts the settings, the pixmap interface is used to draw
the given text using the given parameters.

\section2 lines()

The lines function draws a number of lines, each starting at the center of the canvas 
and ending at a point on the periphery of the largest oval shape that can fit on the canvas.
Each line is drawn at a distance of ten degrees from the previous. 

\section2 Qt()

The Qt function draws the Qt Logo scaled to the size of the canvas onto the
canvas. It uses the drawing function of the pixmap interface to do the
drawing. 

\section2 simpleGradient()

This function fills the canvas with a gradient from red to blue. 

To Add a new function to this application: 
\list
\o Click the Edit Scripts button to open the Qt Script for
Applications window
\o Click main.qs, which is the file for adding new functions
\o Add the new function to the file
\o Return to the Scribblescripter application window
\o Click the Update button to add the new function to the list
\endlist
